# Teamwork

A Google Calendar scraper that eventually should crank out reports on
whether a team isn't interrupted too much.

An interrupt-free day is when there are no meetings that day for anyone,
unless it's a day-long meeting with just one participant (PTO, for example).
Rules subject to debate.

## Usage

Read code, do `iex -S mix`, follow login instructions (one time only),
read code, play.
